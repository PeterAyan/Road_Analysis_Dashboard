# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

## Introduction

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of road accidents, providing valuable insights and recommendations to enhance road safety measures. By leveraging data visualisation techniques, the analysis aims to identify patterns, trends, and contributing factors related to accidents, ultimately supporting informed decision-making processes.

## Aim and Objectives

The primary aim of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that enables stakeholders, policymakers, and the general public to gain a deeper understanding of road accident dynamics. The specific objectives are as follows:

1. **Analyse Accident Severity**: Investigate the distribution of fatal, serious, and slight accidents, highlighting the areas that require immediate attention and targeted interventions.

2. **Identify Contributing Factors**: Examine the influence of various factors, such as weather conditions, road types, urban/rural areas, and vehicle types, on accident occurrences.

3. **Visualise Temporal and Spatial Patterns**: Provide visual representations of accident trends over time and their geographic distribution, enabling the identification of hotspots and high-risk areas.

4. **Facilitate Data Exploration**: Develop an interactive dashboard that allows users to filter and explore the data based on specific criteria, such as weather conditions, road conditions, and accident dates.

## About the Dashboard

The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive tool that combines multiple visualisations and interactive features to present a holistic view of road accident data. Key components include:

- **Accident Statistics**: An overview of the total number of accidents, categorised by severity levels were determined with the use of Data Analysis Expression(DAX)
- **Environmental Factors**: Analysis of the impact of weather and road conditions, as well as lighting conditions (daylight/darkness), on accident occurrences.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Visualizations depicting the distribution of accidents in rural and urban areas, as well as a geographic map for spatial analysis.
- **Road Type and Vehicle Involvement**: Insights into the relationship between road types, accident severity, and vehicle types involved in accidents.
- **Monthly Trends**: Visualisation of accident occurrences over the course of a year, allowing for the identification of seasonal patterns or spikes.
- **Slicers Panel**: Interactive filtering capabilities based on weather conditions, road conditions, and accident dates, enabling users to explore specific scenarios.

## Insights and Recommendations

Through the analysis presented in this dashboard, several key insights and recommendations can be derived:

1. **Targeted Interventions**: Identify high-risk areas, road types, or environmental conditions that contribute significantly to accidents, and prioritize resource allocation and safety measures accordingly.

2. **Infrastructure Improvements**: Evaluate the need for infrastructure upgrades, such as road maintenance, lighting enhancements, or traffic management systems, in areas with higher accident rates.

3. **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Develop targeted public awareness campaigns to educate drivers, pedestrians, and other road users about road safety practices, particularly in areas or conditions with higher accident risks.

4. **Vehicle Safety Regulations**: Assess the need for stricter vehicle safety regulations, especially for vehicle types that are disproportionately involved in accidents, to improve overall road safety.

5. **Collaborative Efforts**: Foster collaboration among relevant stakeholders, including government agencies, law enforcement, transportation authorities, and community organizations, to implement comprehensive road safety strategies.

By leveraging the insights derived from this Road Accident Analysis Dashboard, policymakers and authorities can make data-driven decisions to enhance road safety, reduce accident rates, and ultimately save lives.
